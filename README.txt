To run, use all files within folder Project 1.
Open main.py and run (given the standard libraries and packages referenced in the headers are installed).

Generates:

1) model_results.txt 
    - this file contains the performance characteristics (timing and accuracy) for each of the models on the datasets
2) Various plots of the performance of each model on each dataset
    - Validation curves, learning curves, and loss curve for Neural Network

That should be it!
